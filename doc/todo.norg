* To Dos
  - (x) Separate capture logic into its on module.
  - ( ) Write test cases for all functions so that you know when you mess something up.
  - (x) Refactor the picker logic. 
  - ( ) Separate find logic into its own module?.
  - ( ) Add workspace keymaps, i.e. Capture to workspace, find note in workspace, etc. Just add `w`
	after commands to prompt for a workspace name. I.e. `<leader>nfw` should prompt for a workspace
	to search through. How should this work for links though? I think you should only be able to
	link within the current workspace?
  - ( ) Capture templates
  - ( ) SQL moduleÂ 
  - ( ) Back links (super important)
  - ( ) Tags ?
  - ( ) Other types of linkables.


* Capture templates
  This is a section about capture templates.

** Supported Syntax 
   - Named capture templates,
   - file (template for the file name)
   - title (title for the document metadata)
   - narrowed (t/f) if the capture should narrow to only show the current capture entry.
   - `{table of inserted text}`
   - substitutions with `{foo}` syntax which will check for a defined function foo, or
	 `{foo=default}` to insert default if foo doesn't exist.
   - Need pre defined functions here like `{datetime}` and `{datetimeiso}`, and
	 `{slug}`,`{file_hash}` for the
	 filename slug / hash.
   @code lua
   capture_templates = {
   	template_name = {
   		file = "template/for/filename/{slug}.norg",
   		title="{prompt} this title was prompted for", -- or nil, then it defaults to slug ,
   		narrowed = true, -- or nil or false,
   		tag="a_tag_for_this_type_of_note", -- potentially? for easier searching through notes?
   		template = {"* A list of strings that will be inserted with support for substitutions
   		like {datetime}, {slug}, etc.", "Actually all of the file, title, tag, etc, need to
   		support substitutions."}
   	},
   }
