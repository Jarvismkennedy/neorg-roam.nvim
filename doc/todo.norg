* To Dos
  - (x) Separate capture logic into its on module.
  - ( ) Write test cases for all functions so that you know when you mess something up.
  - (x) Refactor the picker logic. 
  - (x) Capture templates
  - ( ) SQL moduleÂ 
  - ( ) Back links (super important)
  - ( ) Tags ?
  - ( ) Other types of linkables.


* Metadata 
  - Need to implement your own "metagen" module to have custom metadata.
  - Should include: 
  -- title
  -- uuid
  -- created at 
  -- updated at 
  -- The rest should be from capture templates.
* Links
  - Links should include workspace like `{:$personal/index:}[personal index]` so that linking to
	other workspaces works properly
  - How can we make renaming files not break links? I guess just from the renamed file run neorg-roam update
	links... but you shouldnt need to do this.
* SQLite
  - Implement a db per workspace, require listing the roam workspaces in config. default to the `roam` wksp.
** Schemas
*** Notes table
	@table
	| id            | filepath (for opening files) | workspacepath (for inserting links) | title           |
	| ------------- | ----------------             | -----------------                   | --              |
	| int not null  | string not null              | string not null                     | string not null |
	@end

*** Back Links 
	@table
	| source_id      | target_id      | href                                    | lin                |
	| ---            | ---            | --------                                | ---                |
	| FK to notes.Id | FK to notes.Id | string  e.g. `{:$wrkspc/path/to/link:}` | `{:path/to/link:}` |
	@end

** thoughts
   - How should we update links if filename/location changes? I think just run a command from the
	 file which was changed to search for backlinks using uuid, then use treesitter to update the
	 link path in those files.
   - Need to db-sync to generate the db from files. Take a look at org-roam to see how they implement db-syncing.

* Capture templates
  - Improvements to capture templates.
  - Insert after any tree sitter node. - Then make a capture template example which will let you
	choose which heading to insert after.
